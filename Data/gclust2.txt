267364_at	ELF4	Encodes a novel nuclear 111 amino-acid phytochrome-regulated component of a negative feedback loop involving the circadian clock central oscillator components CCA1 and LHY. ELF4 is necessary for light-induced expression of both CCA1 and LHY, and conversely, CCA1 and LHY act negatively on light-induced ELF4 expression.  ELF4 promotes clock accuracy and is required for sustained rhythms in the absence of daily light/dark cycles.  It is involved in the phyB-mediated constant red light induced seedling de-etiolation process and may function to coregulate the expression of a subset of phyB-regulated genes.	2	-16734294	AT2G40080	818596	12214234, 15659097, 15734916, 14605220, 15908595, 16212608, 16908503, 16891401, 17132630, 17384164, 17468223, 18676661, 18799658, 19843842, 20351290, 20357892, 21255161, 21499259, 21753751, 22284718, 22328721, 22327739, 22307044	GO:0003674: molecular_function, GO:0005634: nucleus, GO:0005634: nucleus, GO:0009648: photoperiodism, GO:0009648: photoperiodism, GO:0009649: entrainment of circadian clock, GO:0009909: regulation of flower development, GO:0010017: red or far-red light signaling pathway, GO:0010114: response to red light, GO:0042753: positive regulation of circadian rhythm, GO:0042803: protein homodimerization activity, GO:0048573: photoperiodism, flowering, GO:0080167: response to karrikin

254060_at	SHB1	SHB1 encodes a nuclear and cytosolic protein that has motifs  homologous with SYG1 protein family members. Acts in cryptochrome signaling. Overexpression of SHB1 enhanced the expression of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING  FACTOR4 (PIF4) under red light and promoted proteasome-mediated degradation of phytochrome A and hypocotyl elongation under far-red light. A knockout allele suppressed LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED LIGHT1 (HFR1) expression and showed several deetiolation  phenotypes. Acts upstream of HFR1. Regulates seed development.	4	-12963382	AT4G25350	828638	15122012, 16500988, 19141706, 19406114, 20354198, 22995285	GO:0005634: nucleus, GO:0005829: cytosol, GO:0005886: plasma membrane, GO:0006817: phosphate ion transport, GO:0006857: oligopeptide transport, GO:0009960: endosperm development, GO:0010017: red or far-red light signaling pathway, GO:0010468: regulation of gene expression, GO:0016021: integral component of membrane, GO:0016036: cellular response to phosphate starvation, GO:0045793: positive regulation of cell size, GO:0080050: regulation of seed development, GO:0080113: regulation of seed growth

252572_at	ATMLO3, MLO3	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO3 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in primary root and lateral root primordia, in fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons and in trichomes of young leaves,; it was not expressed in mature rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s)., A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein.

This family includes five groups based on phylogenetic analysis (FEBS Letters (2007) 581: 2357): I (inward rectifying channel): AKT1 (AT2G26650), AKT5 (AT4G32500) and SPIK (also known as AKT6, AT2G25600); II (inward rectifying channel): KAT1 (AT5G46240) and KAT2 (AT4G18290); III (weakly inward rectifying channel): AKT2 (AT4G22200); IV (regulatory subunit involved in inwardly rectifying conductance formation): KAT3 (also known as AtKC1, AT4G32650); V (outward rectifying channel): SKOR (AT3G02850) and GORK (AT5G37500). Mutants have increased water consumption and limited stomatal closure in response to abscisic and jasmonic acids. It forms a heteromeric K(out) channels with SKOR. The gene is expressed ubiquitously in root and the vasculature and guard cells of leaves. Expression is suppressed during agrobacterium-induced tumor formation and increased in response to water deprivation and cold.	5	-14889692	AT5G37500	833728	11113445, 11842166, 11904452, 11500563, 12671068, 12795698, 14596925, 15064385, 15298894, 19181866, 20375061, 20626656, 21518051, 22645532	GO:0005515: protein binding, GO:0005634: nucleus, GO:0005634: nucleus, GO:0009409: response to cold, GO:0009414: response to water deprivation, GO:0009737: response to abscisic acid, GO:0009753: response to jasmonic acid, GO:0015271: outward rectifier potassium channel activity, GO:0015271: outward rectifier potassium channel activity, GO:0030551: cyclic nucleotide binding

TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).	2	-13258329, -13258329	AT2G31110	817667	15659355, 17316173, 18650403, 20388664, 20657172	GO:0008150: biological_process
